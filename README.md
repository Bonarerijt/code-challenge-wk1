# SPEED DETECTOR

# Date, 2025/09/10

#### By *Judy Ogachi*

## Description
It's a program that takes as input the speed of a car. The speed limit is set at 70 and any speed below that is okay. Otherwise for every 5 km/s above the speed limit, demerits are given. Our program then prints out the total number of demerits based on the car's speed. The higher the demerit point the higher the risk of license suspension.
